\begin{step}
%Ingredients for this step
5 tablespoons white bread , cubed
3 tablespoons grated cheddar
3 tablespoon cooked ham
To taste Salt and pepper
\method
Add the bread, ham, cheese and salt and pepper. Stir until combined.

Let it stand for 5 minutes for the bread to soak up the custard. Press it down so the bread is submerged within the liquid.

Microwave (1200W) for roughly 1Â½ - 2 minutes. I suggest checking it after 1 minute and go from there.
