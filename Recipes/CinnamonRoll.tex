In a large microwavable mug add in the oats, cinnamon, brown sugar, milk and water and stir. You need to use a large mug as the mix can bubble up.

Place in the microwave (1200W) and cook for 1 minutes. Stir the oatmeal and then continue cooking at 20-30 second intervals or until the oatmeal is cooked. Keep a close eye as it cooks as you donâ€™t want it to overflow in your microwave.
